# Tasks: Telegram Marketplace Application

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-build-an-application/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✓), research.md (✓), data-model.md (✓), contracts/ (✓)

## ⚠️ CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY (Updated 2025-09-18)

**What's Actually Working:**
- ✅ **Frontend webapp** (localhost:5173) - Most React components exist and work
- ✅ **Basic backend worker** (localhost:8787) - Minimal API with health, categories, listings endpoints
- ✅ **Bot foundation** - Basic commands (/start, /help, /question) exist
- ✅ **Test structure** - 152 test files exist (TDD approach), but 150/229 tests fail due to missing implementation
- ✅ **Dependencies** - All required packages installed

**What's Missing (marked as ✓ but NOT implemented):**
- ❌ **Backend structure** - Missing: services/, api/, middleware/, admin/, kv/, r2/, dev/ folders
- ❌ **Database models** - No models/ folder, only basic db structure
- ❌ **API endpoints** - Tests expect /miniApp/* but worker has /api/*, most endpoints return 404
- ❌ **Authentication** - No proper auth system implemented
- ❌ **Complex features** - KV caching, R2 storage, admin panel, moderation, premium features

**Key Issues:**
1. **Test/Implementation Mismatch** - Tests were created (TDD) but implementation is incomplete
2. **API URL Mismatch** - Frontend uses external backend (devtunnel), local worker has different endpoints
3. **Structure Gap** - Many folders/files marked as complete don't exist

**Legend:**
- [x] = Actually implemented and working
- [~] = Partially implemented
- [!] = Test exists but implementation missing/incomplete
- [ ] = Not done

This file has been updated to reflect the ACTUAL state vs original markings.

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓
   → Extract: CloudFlare Workers, Hono, Grammy, React, Drizzle ORM
   → Structure: Web application (backend + frontend)
2. Load design documents ✓:
   → data-model.md: 12 entities for Telegram marketplace
   → contracts/: API schema with 25+ endpoints
   → research.md: Technical decisions for architecture
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Restructure existing code to specification folders
   → Tests: Contract tests, integration tests with mock users
   → Core: Database models, services, bot commands, API endpoints
   → Integration: KV caching, image processing, admin functions
   → Polish: Performance testing, browser automation, load testing
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
   → Existing code reorganization first
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T114)
6. Focus: Enhance existing working code with new features
```

## Dependencies

- Setup (T001-T008) before all other phases
- Contract tests (T009-T039) before implementation (T040-T094)
- Models (T040-T050) before services (T051-T059)
- Services before endpoints (T064-T085)
- Bot commands (T060-T063) depend on webhook setup (T102)
- Frontend components (T086-T094) can run parallel with backend after auth (T064)
- Integration (T095-T102) after core implementation
- Testing & performance (T103-T110) after integration complete
- Documentation (T111-T114) after all implementation

## Parallel Example

```
# Launch contract tests together (T009-T030):
Task: "Contract test POST /api/auth in tests/contract/test_auth_post.ts"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/me in tests/contract/test_me_get.ts"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/categories in tests/contract/test_categories_get.ts"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/listings in tests/contract/test_listings_get.ts"

# Launch models together (T040-T050):
Task: "User model with Telegram integration in backend/src/db/models/user.ts"
Task: "Category model with 2-level hierarchy in backend/src/db/models/category.ts"
Task: "Listing model with premium features in backend/src/db/models/listing.ts"
Task: "Flag model for content moderation in backend/src/db/models/flag.ts"
```

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files/modules, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing functionality
- Keep existing T001-T008 code reorganization tasks as foundation
- Mock users enable comprehensive local testing without Telegram integration
- KV caching critical for sub-200ms performance goals
- Admin functionality controlled via ADMIN_ID environment variable
- Premium features use Telegram Stars payment integration
- Archive system preserves data instead of deletion
- Browser automation tests validate complete user journeys
- Artillery load testing ensures concurrent user performance

## Task Generation Rules

1. **From Contracts (api-schema.yaml)**:
   - 29 endpoints → 22 contract test tasks [P] + implementation tasks
   - Authentication, listings, admin, development sections

2. **From Data Model**:
   - 12 entities → 11 model creation tasks [P]
   - Services layer for business logic [P]

3. **From Quickstart Scenarios**:
   - 12 test scenarios → integration test tasks [P]
   - E2E browser automation tests

4. **From Implementation Plan**:
   - Code restructuring from existing functional deployment
   - CloudFlare Workers + Pages architecture
   - TypeScript, Hono, Grammy, React, Drizzle ORM tech stack

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All 29 contract endpoints have corresponding tests
- [x] All 12 entities have model tasks
- [x] All tests come before implementation (TDD enforced)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files/modules)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Existing T001-T008 reorganization tasks preserved
- [x] Mock user system enables comprehensive testing
- [x] Admin functionality and premium features covered
- [x] Performance and load testing included
